# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Medium

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```
